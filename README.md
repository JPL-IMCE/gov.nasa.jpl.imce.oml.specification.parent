This composite project comprises several sub-projects:
- [An ecore metamodel for the OML specification](./jpl.imce.oml.specification.ecore)
- [A textual concrete syntax for OML models](./jpl.imce.oml.specification)
- Several projects generated from XCore IDE wizards

## Installation in Eclipse using a version of the [JPL IMCE OML Specification P2](https://bintray.com/jpl-imce/gov.nasa.jpl.imce.p2/jpl.imce.oml.specification.p2) repository

See [jpl.imce.oml.specification.repository/README.md](jpl.imce.oml.specification.repository/README.md)

## Developer Notes

This project is developed using two IDEs: Eclipse & Intellij IDEA Ultimate.
It would be nice if a single IDE could handle all the requirements.
 
### Eclipse Neon.2 

Specifically, the Eclipse Neon.2 Modeling package which includes EMF, CDO, EGIT augmented with the following:
- XText Complete SDK (2.10.0)
- Modeling/EMF - Eclipse Modeling Framework Xcore SDK (1.4.0)
- Modeling/Sirus * (4.1.2)
- Buildship Gradle Integration 2.0
- Scala IDE (4.5.0)

In principle, it should be possible to use Eclipse Oomph to configure
a package with the above; in practice, it is unfortunately not obvious
how to do this despite several attempts. 

### Intellij IDEA Ultimate

All the SBT build configuration was developed using IDEA.
The [gov.nasa.jpl.imce.oml.specification.tables] module is a polyglot functional API 
for the normalized relational table schema of the Ontological Modeling Language.
This API is written in Scala; however, it is cross-compiled for both the JVM and Node/JavaScript.
Correspondingly, this SBT project has two sub-projects, `tablesJVM` and `tablesJS` respectively.
Most of the Scala source code is shared; however, some Scala source code is specific to `tablesJVM`
and other to `tablesJS`. There is also some source code in Java and JavaScript.

### Benefits of SBT

It handles a lot of the continuous integration paradigms used across several projects
(see https://github.com/JPL-IMCE). In particular:

- Third-party dependencies are aggregated in a big zip archive.

  In principle, this could be avoided using a powerful Maven repository like Artifactory
  that can be configured for proxying selected artifacts from other repositories.
  In practice, it is still an advanced topic, one that seems to be restricted to a 
  non-public deployment of Artifactory. 
  
  This aggregation in SBT is a simple idea enables Continuous Integration on https://travis-ci.org/jpl-imce.

- Cross building

- Compile-time type checking of build scripts

### Benefits of Gradle

Thanks to the Gradle-based Eclipse Buildship, it is possible to:
- construct a local Mavenized repository from specific Eclipse feature target dependencies
- run all the Xtext/Xtend/Xcore-based code generation 
- build the Eclipse-based projects plugins, features & p2 repos 
- execute the unit tests

However, there are some caveats.

### Caveats about Gradle

Although Gradle is conceptually very similar to SBT (i.e., execution of a graph of tasks based on their dependencies),
the fact that Gradle is dynamically typed and SBT is statically typed means that:
- Gradle scripting looses the benefits that SBT scripting enjoys with static, compile-time checking. 
- It can be difficult to understand what a particular Gradle script really does because the runtime dependency injection
  that ultimately determines the actual runtime behavior can be difficult to find.
  
Following the suggestion from [Bugzilla â€“ Bug 469287 (CLOSED WONTFIX)](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=469287),
this project includes a copy of the internal gradle plugins that Eclipse buildship uses for building/publishing.
Several Eclipse test-related scripts were deleted because of errors.

However, following [Eclipse buildship developer setup instructions](https://github.com/eclipse/buildship/blob/master/docs/development/Setup.md) 
turns out to be a non-trivial affair:
- Adding the Java & Groovy nature (and possibly Gradle nature) would be required to get JDT support for
  editing the buildship Java+Groovy scripts in [buildSrc/src/main/groovy](buildSrc/src/main/groovy).
  However, doing so brings a lot of compilation errors; including the fact that without the Gradle 3.3 libraries,
  a lot of imports are unresolved.
  
- The Eclipse buildship support can add gradle nature; however, it doesn't add Gradle 3.3 to the project classpath.
  This means that there is no JDT support for editing gradle scripts!

- Debugging gradle scripts is tedious with Eclipse Buildship.

Intellij IDEA (2017.1 EAP) provides very good support for gradle projects.

- IDEA can run/debug gradle tasks easily like anything else JVM-based.

### Caveats about Eclipse Xtext/Xtend/Xcore

Currently, this project uses the Eclipse-based tooling.
The generated code is currently in GIT; however, there is some code generation noise that
causes frivolous changes:
- the `@Override` annotation is sometimes generated; sometimes not.
- the generated `ecore.ecore` from the Xcore metamodel varies, primarily due to variations in serialization order
- the generated `.classpath` files have platform-specific paths -- it is unclear whether these files can be
  ignored in GIT and re-generated properly.

## Continuous Integration

For continuous integration & development, this project should be buildable from a shell (unix/cygwin) using gradle.
The first step involves installing an Eclipse target platform according to the features defined in [tooling-e46.target](tooling-e46.target).

	% cd .../jpl.imce.oml.specification.parent
	% gradle :installTargetPlatform
	
This can take a while....

The target is installed in ` ~/.tooling/eclipse/targetPlatforms/46`

The second step is to build the remaining projects:

	% gradle build


It is possible to operate on a particular sub-project, either by switching to that sub-project's directory
or by specifying a sub-project task. To get the gradle syntax for specifying sub-project specific tasks, use:

	% cd .../jpl.imce.oml.specification.parent
	% gradle projects


This should produce something like this:

	:projects
	------------------------------------------------------------
	Root project
	------------------------------------------------------------
	
    Root project 'jpl.imce.oml.specification.parent'
    +--- Project ':gov.nasa.jpl.imce.oml.specification.doc'
    +--- Project ':gov.nasa.jpl.imce.oml.specification.scala.generators'
    +--- Project ':jpl.imce.oml.specification'
    +--- Project ':jpl.imce.oml.specification.ecore'
    +--- Project ':jpl.imce.oml.specification.ecore.edit'
    +--- Project ':jpl.imce.oml.specification.ecore.editor'
    +--- Project ':jpl.imce.oml.specification.feature'
    +--- Project ':jpl.imce.oml.specification.ide'
    +--- Project ':jpl.imce.oml.specification.idea'
    +--- Project ':jpl.imce.oml.specification.repository'
    +--- Project ':jpl.imce.oml.specification.tests'
    +--- Project ':jpl.imce.oml.specification.ui'
    +--- Project ':jpl.imce.oml.specification.ui.tests'
    \--- Project ':jpl.imce.oml.specification.web'

	To see a list of the tasks of a project, run gradle <project-path>:tasks
	For example, try running gradle :jpl.imce.oml.specification:tasks
	
	BUILD SUCCESSFUL
	
	Total time: 0.674 secs

-

For example, to build the Xcore concrete syntax from the *.xtext & *.xtend sources, either:

	% cd .../jpl.imce.oml.specification.parent
	% gradle :jpl.imce.oml.specification:build

or:

	% cd .../jpl.imce.oml.specification.parent/jpl.imce.oml.specification
	% gradle build

Either way, gradle will use the common settings specified in the parent (this project);
in particular, the repositories for resolving dependencies.

## Versioning

### Summary

For changing the version, either:
- update the [gradle.properties](gradle.properties) file.
- override it on the command line with `-Pversion=...`
